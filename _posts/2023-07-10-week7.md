title: Week 7
---

During the 7th week of the program, my partner and I tried to wrap up previous works to prepare for moving onto new topics using APS and categories. Arjun worked to write up an algorithm for ordered instances using categories, which is an unlikely instance but a good step in the direction for using categories. I worked on writing up code to find counterexamples for a proportion of the MMS. Essentially, I hope to find a set of items and corresponding valuations such that there is no assignment that satisfies x-MMS where x is a proportion between 2/3 and 1. I constructed an integer program that creates an assignment that maximizes total wealth while ensuring each object is assigned to exactly one person, each person has maximum ki items, and that every agent receives x proportion of their MMS. I will continue to randomly generate item values, rescale such that MMS is 1, and then check if there is no solution in the IP, in which case, there would be a counterexample. I am starting with x = 8/9, and hope to find a counterexample and then decrease x. I started with examples with 4 agents, since it has been proving that 1-MMS can be acheived in all scenarios given 3 or fewer agents. I will also increase the number of agents if we fail to find a counterexample after too many tries. My partner and I also focused on reading papers on APS (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04304v4) and on a different method than we had previously attempted regarding chores.

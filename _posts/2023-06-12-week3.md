title: Week 3
---

During the third week of the DREU program, I attended an online summer school on current research areas in theoretical computer science (https://newhorizons.ttic.edu/). I participated in a number of mini-courses, problem-solving sessions, and ice-breaker activities which exposed me to new CS topics and social connections. I did not learn much that would contribute to my current research project, but the program did allow me to understand which areas of research I would prefer to continue in, during the DREU program and in graduate school. The courses took up most of the day, so I did not have much time to work on something new. Instead, Arjun and I spent the week focusing on proving an algorithm that achieves a 2/3-MMS allocation of goods. We managed to formally write up the introduction, algorithm, and most of the proof before running into a slight problem. We need to find a new way to approach the proof for one specific case, and if we manage to do so, we will be able to proceed with submitting the proof. Afterwards, we can contiunue to prove similar ideas with new notions of fiarness, such as APS, or for chores instead of goods.

## About Me

I am a rising Senior at Cornell University, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics, Operations Research, and Game Design. I am particularly interested in Algorithms and Theory in Computer Science. 

## About My Mentor

My mentor is Dr. Ruta Mehta, an Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. She also has a research interest in Theoretical Computer Science.

## About My Project

This summer, Professor Mehta and myself will be exploring different notions of fairness, such as Envy-freeness, Proportionality, and MMS. With these we will explore which measurements can be guaranteed in problems of distributing indivisible items to a collection of agents who each give value to the items, and if we can find approximation factors and algorithms for those that can be.
